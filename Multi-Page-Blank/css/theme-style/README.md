# Theme CSS files.

Why this is cool...

Because every sleet HTML theme will have these css files.

So if you like the header from one you can copy the header.css file.
Or if you like the nav from another.
This makes it easy to mix and match.

And also it is surpirsing how much css it takes to make a great looking header, nav, body, or footer, so that is why we need separate files for each.
